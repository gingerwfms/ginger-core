Backend Core of the Ginger WfMS
-------------------------------

The [Ginger Workflow Management System](https://github.com/gingerwfms/ginger-wfms) is a module driven system.
Each part is an own ZF2 module, with an associated github repo, a composer package and a travis-ci build.
The gingerwfms/ginger-core provides the infrastructure for the entire system. You can find the 
CQRS layer as well as the persistence layer.
